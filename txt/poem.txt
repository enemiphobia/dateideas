Each time I look at you
Each moment I simply glance
Butterflies materialize in my stomach
I become entranced
With your presence
My eyes, ears, and lips feel adored
And even from a trivial message; I'm willing
to halt my deceit and lies-
cry true tears-
to let my doubts and worries falter-
si es con mi amor (if it's with my love)

As each minute passes by,
Swiftly, swiftly, oh so swiftly
I fall further into your endless, comforting eyes
Briskly, briskly, oh so briskly.
A beautiful utopia
That opened up to me like a well-used book
A place that I find solace
All I needed to do was look

It feels as if before I met you
I was just a broken china rabbit
Sinking not by my own accord
I fell to the bottom of the ocean
Born to be a sailor, yet torn apart by my terrifying realities
But I found my north star
I regained morality
And all my cluttering thoughts swept away
As I float up to what I call my home

The constant repetition of simple, yet powerful statements
diminishes how much the meaning is overlooked,
catastrophic disappointments
And if I knew how to say
i love you
the way I mean it in my soul
I would burn it into your chest
Because I too know
how much meaning those words hold.

The concept of time-
past
present
future
means nothing to me now
And as our story unfurls
I have no fear of looking backward or forward
As long as I can call you my girl
